### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Hi, this is BegÃ¼m. I am an MSc. student in the Linguistics Department at UniversitÃ¤t Potsdam. I am currently working in the project [SFB 1287 - Limits of Variability in Language](https://www.sfb1287.uni-potsdam.de/en/overview/). In the project, we collect data from different (S)VO and (S)OV languages and investigate the systematic syntactic differences between them.

Besides theoretical linguistics, I am also interested in the intersection of sociolinguistics and computational linguistics. 

Outside academia, I am an avid binge watcher and a crocheter.
